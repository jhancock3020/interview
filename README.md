# SOSI Technical Review Questions

This repo contains a selection of problems that embody some of the programming concepts we use here at SOSi.

*Please fork this repository into your own Github, we will use the fork for reference during the interview.*

There are 2 problems in total:

- A Golang (1.14) problem (REST API concepts, pointers, concurrency)
- A VueJS problem (Javascript, Node, Vue Framework, single page applications)

Please attempt every problem! Each one is challenging in it's own way and we are most interested in seeing the way you approach a variety of different challenges.

During the interview, we will discuss the problems that have been attempted, and any challenges faced during implementation.

**If you have any issues at all with configuration of environments, installation of tools, or the general nature of any of the problems, please reach out sooner rather than later! Contact information is in the email you received**
