// PROBLEM DESCRIPTION:
// Your goal here is to design an API that allows for hero tracking, much like the Vue problem
// You are to implement an API (for which the skeleton already exists) that has the following capabilities
// - Get      : return a JSON representation of the hero with the name supplied
// - Make     : create a superhero according to the JSON body supplied
// - Calamity : a calamity of the supplied level requires heroes with an equivalent or greater combined powerlevel to address it.
//              Takes a calamity with powerlevel and at least 1 hero. On success return a 200 with json response indicating the calamity has been resolved.
//              Otherwise return a response indicating that the heroes were not up to the task. Addressing a calamity adds 1 point of exhaustion.
// - Rest     : recover 1 point of exhaustion
// - Retire   : retire a superhero, someone may take up his name for the future passing on the title
// - Kill     : a superhero has passed away, his name may not be taken up again.

// On success all endpoints should return a status code 200.

// If a hero reaches an exhaustion level of maxExhaustion then they die.

// You are free to decide what your API endpoints should be called and what shape they should take. You can modify any code in this file however you'd like.

// NOTE: you may want to install postman or another request generating software of your choosing to make testing easier. (api is running on localhost port 8081)

// NOTE the second: the API is receiving asynchronous requests to manage our super friends. As such, your hero access should be thread-safe.
// Even if the operations are extremely lightweight we want to make our application scalable.
// Your multithreaded protection should allow the API to still be performant even if these requests took a reasonably long time. This means that
// a global lock/mutex that makes the API only handle 1 request at a time is not an acceptable solution to this problem

// NOTE the third: There are many ways to make whatever package-level tracking you implement thread-safe, feel free to change anything about this file (without changing the functionality of the program) to do so.
// i.e. add package-level maps, add functions that take the hero struct as reference, modify the hero struct, creating access control paradigms
// I highly recommend looking into channels, mutexes, and other golang memory management patterns and pick whatever you're most comfortable with.
// For mad props: a timeout on the memory management process which returns a resource not available.

// Bonus: If you're having fun (this is by no means necessary) you can make the calamity hold the heroes up for a time and delay their unlocking in a go-routine
// example:
// go func(h *hero) {
//     time.Sleep(calamityTime)
//     // release lock on hero
// }(heroPtr)
